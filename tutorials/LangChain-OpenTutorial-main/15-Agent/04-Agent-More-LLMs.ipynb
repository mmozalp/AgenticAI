        "LangChain is not limited to `OpenAI` models. It also supports implementations from diverse LLM providers such as `Anthropic`, `Google Gemini`, `Together.ai`, `Ollama`, and `Mistral`. This flexibility allows developers to leverage the unique characteristics and strengths of each model to create agents optimized specific requirements for their applications.\n",
